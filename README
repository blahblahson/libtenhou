libtenhou 1.0
2014-04-19  bps (bps@arcturus.su)

libtenhou is a perl library for interface with the popular online Japanese
mahjong service Tenhou (see: tenhou.net). Most of the documentation is found in
each file itself, since they have been organised into discrete categories.

This is just a collation of many generic subroutines that have been written
over the years for various pieces of Tenhou-related software of mine. The vast
majority of code dates back to early 2009, with the exception of auth.pl and
the gtype files.

The gtype part of the library was written originally for the backend of
ranking.pl, so there is thorough documentation here. Up to its marked "last
reviewed" date (see the bottom of gtype.pl), this file should be considered
100% stable for parsing of gtype strings.

This is a long time coming. Most code I've written is not closed-source out of
choice so much as lack of effort. This is the first step in publishing large
amounts of Tenhou related code. I hope also to provide thorough documentation
in future, as well as update tenhoudoc.txt.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me on bps@arcturus.su, or find
me on the usual IRC channels as "alvin".
